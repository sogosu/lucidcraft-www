## Session 2: Figma MCP Setup and Configuration
**Date**: 2025-09-04
**Time**: Continued from Session 1

### Completed Tasks
1. ✅ **Figma MCP Server Installation**
   - Installed figma-dev-mode-mcp-server via Claude MCP command
   - Configured Figma desktop app with Local MCP Server enabled
   - Documentation reviewed from Figma help center

2. ✅ **Project Preparation**
   - Reverted placeholder pages to original state
   - Ready for pixel-perfect implementation from Figma design
   - All testing infrastructure remains in place

### Current Status
- **Figma Setup**: MCP server installed, awaiting Claude Code restart
- **Figma File**: "Lucidcraft - Website" should be open in Figma desktop
- **Next Steps**: After restart, will access Figma design and begin implementation

### Technical Configuration
```bash
# Figma MCP server installed with:
claude mcp add --transport http figma-dev-mode-mcp-server http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp

# Verification command:
claude mcp list
```

### Files Ready for Implementation
- `/app/page.tsx` - Home page (template state)
- `/app/contact/page.tsx` - To be created
- `/app/privacy/page.tsx` - To be created  
- `/app/terms/page.tsx` - To be created

### Testing Infrastructure Ready
- Visual regression tests configured
- Responsive tests for desktop/tablet/mobile
- Accessibility tests prepared
- Screenshot automation ready

### Notes for Next Session
1. Verify Figma MCP tools are available (should see `mcp__figma__` prefixed tools)
2. Access "Lucidcraft - Website" design file
3. Begin pixel-perfect implementation
4. Run visual tests after each component implementation
5. Ensure responsive design across all breakpoints
